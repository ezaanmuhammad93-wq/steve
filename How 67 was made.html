                <h2>The Sacred Number</h2>
                <p>The number 67 has become a cultural phenomenon, especially among younger generations. It is often used in memes, social media posts,  and casual conversations to express excitement, approval, or simply as a humorous non-sequitur.</p>

                <h2>How It Corrupted Every Brainrot Kid's Mind</h2>
                <p>In 2025, the "6-7" (six-seven) meme, often described as a form of "brain rot," spread rapidly among Gen Alpha and
                younger Gen Z, becoming a ubiquitous, nonsensical catchphrase in classrooms and online spaces. It was defined by
                Dictionary.com as the 2025 Word of the Year, representing a cultural phenomenon of meaningless, algorithm-driven
                internet slang.</p>
